# Automated LinkedIn Content Workflow with n8n  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project is my **third n8n automation workflow**, designed to streamline content creation and publishing for LinkedIn. Its main purpose is to help busy professionals stay active on LinkedIn by automatically generating posts from articles they read.

## üöÄ How It Works  
1. **Article Scraping**  
   - The workflow scrapes articles and extracts key ideas.  
   - These ideas are stored in a **Google Sheet** as potential post drafts.  

2. **Scheduled Posting**  
   - On a defined schedule, the workflow checks the Google Sheet.  
   - It selects the next available post context and prepares it for publishing.  

3. **Post Generation with Gemini**  
   - Using **Google‚Äôs Gemini model**, the workflow expands the context into a full LinkedIn post.  

4. **Image Generation with Pollinations.ai**  
   - The workflow generates **three images** for each post using `pollinations.ai`.  
   - Since AI images may contain errors, generating multiple options allows the user to **choose the most suitable one**.  

5. **Google Docs Review Option**  
   - Before posting, the workflow can send an **email containing the draft post in a Google Doc**.  
   - The user can review, edit, or adjust the content directly in the document.  
   - The same email also includes the three generated images so the user can pick one for the final post.  

## üéØ Use Case  
This workflow was built for a **Business Development professional** who:  
- Regularly reads articles in their field.  
- Wants to stay active and build their personal brand on LinkedIn.  
- Doesn‚Äôt have enough time to manually write posts and design visuals.  

With this automation, the user only needs to **read articles and approve/edit posts when necessary**. The workflow handles the rest.
